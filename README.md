Data-Processing-Program
=======================

The research project analyzes one endangered species of deer by having them wear a device around their neck called the "Critter Cam." The "Critter Cam" collects data about their life habits such as movements and interactions with other animals. Over a period of time, the wireless devices analyzed 10 deer for 12 consecutive days. The data collected by the device includes GPS locations, acceleration points, and radio connectivity. 

The goal of the computer program is to integrate tremendous amounts of data into one streamlined display. The technical data is visualized in creative ways, enabling researchers to see the data together for the first time, especially in a way they can intuitively understand. 

There are numerous long-term effects that this program can have on this research project. First is that the streamlined display will steer researchers in a clearer direction to improve the crittercam device before their next deployment. In addition, the wildlife conservationists can observe what the deer are doing at certain timestamps and locations.
